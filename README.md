# Current Version of Forge Journal
As of the time of this writing, v1.1.0 of Forge Journal has been released for MacOS. 

Forge Journal is a stock trading and investing portfolio dashboard that uses net cash flow accounting to help you visualize true performance of your trades and holdings. The app currently takes into account Buy, Sell and Dividend transactions to derive an "Effective Price per Share" for each of your holdings. The Dashboard page currently displays several widgets such as History (a daily graph of value change), Allocation (pie chart analysis of your portfolio holdings By Initial Cost, and By Current Value to display the change over time), and Winners & Losers (a Profit/Loss Bar Graph that displays strongest and weakest holdings). 

Forge Journal is an app that runs entirely locally on your machine. This means we don't ask you to create any account credentials, we are not receiving or storing any of your personal data, and we are not subjecting you to annoying ads or offers. At the time of this writing, Forge Journal is available exclusively for MacOS, but we are looking to expand to Windows, and potentially mobile applications in the future. 

The app is currently free to download and use. And if downloaded today, it will remain free for you forever. As we continue to add more features to the app, we do intend to begin setting a price to download from the Mac App Store. Here's a roadmap of features we are considering adding in the future: 

### Roadmap
• v1.X.X - initial set of release. Free to use. Features include multi-portfolio setup, manual trade input data, import trade data via CSV file, Dashboard with dynamic updating widgets. Free to use

• v2.X.X - Feature update that allows for importing of Options trading data (Buy to Close, Sell to Close, Expirations, Assignments) that will also impact trading performance by ticker (since we are focusing on Net Cash Flow accounting). Additional widgets on the Dashboard screen. Support for Windows. Price bump to $0.99 

• Exploring more features, metrics, and customization options for v3.X.X +. If there are feature you'd like us to consider, please reach out at the email below.

# Import a CSV feature Template file
There is a Google Sheets template available for you to Copy and update with your own trade data for use with the new Forge Journal "Import a CSV" feature available now in v1.1.0 for MacOS. 

To download the template, please visit [this link]([url](https://tinyurl.com/52jhn4vs)): https://tinyurl.com/52jhn4vs

There are two tabs in the file above, "Instructions" and "Trade Data". If you prefer a different spreadsheet software, you may download the file as a .xlsx and open elsewhere. Please be careful not to change the formatting or the formulas on the "Trade Data" sheet as these are sensitive and critical to the proper functionality of the Forge Journal application.
